9th project in Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree course.

Project Description: The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. THIS PROJECT WILL NOT HAVE ANY UI COMPONENTS; instead, students will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database: 1) Creating a SQLite table in the app; 2) Populating that table with new entries; 3) Modifying the entries; 4) Displaying the contents of the table to users.
